Let's try a more-detailed analysis of the source spectrum than 
[last time](/posts/2012-10-26-spectrum.html).

We start by loading the data into Sherpa and plotting the un-grouped data,
comparing it to he background level (we have to scale by the extraction areas
for the comparison; this value is stored in the elegantly-named `BACKSCAL`
variable):

![The black line is the source and the red line the background level.
The background signal is almost insignificant - earlier I estimated that there are
$\sim 5$ background events in the $64$ events in the source region - except that the
background spectrum has a much-different shape to the source. The source emission
is concentrated below $\sim 2$ keV, whereas the background signal extends across
the whole energy range. This is important because we do not want the high-energy events
biasing the source spectrum (making it try to account for these photons); one
option would be to cut out this energy range from the fit, but we also want to use
the lack of counts here as a constraint on the fit.](/images/source-with-bgnd.png)

So now we try to fit the background; note that we have changed to the
[Cash statistic](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/cash.html) since we are
fitting low-count data (i.e. data for which we can assume a Poission rather than Gaussian
distribution). I have chosen to use a
[Mekal model](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsmekal.html) to account
for emission from our own galaxy and a
[powerlaw model](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/powlaw1d.html) for the other
emission (that corresponds to un-resolved X-ray sources and particle background);
both are 
[absorbed by gas in the galaxy](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsphabs.html)
using the column density used previously:

I have just realised that earlier I used the APEC rather than MEKAL model
for modelling thermal plasmas; for this data set the difference between these
two models should be small.

So, other than suffering several problems in trying to get the model set up,
we can see that the fit is not very good (the local emission should have a temperature below
$\sim 0.2$ keV, and the power-law slope should be no-where near -5).
I have decided to try re-fitting with just the power-law component (since I managed to
get this to work earlier in the day):

I add back in the galaxy emission, tweak the starting temperature to be more realistic,
and fit:

![It is not obvious that the "bump" around 3 keV in the model is a good fit
to the data, but it gives us something to go with.](/images/bgnd-powerlaw-mekal.png)

Now we have a model for the background we try to fit the source; note that, unlike
last time, I have not used the
[subtract command](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/subtract.html), which means
that 
[the fit](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/fit.html) we do will automatically
include the background component, accounting for the difference in `BACKSCAL` value
which I had to do manually in the first plot above.

Oh. I didn't expect this, namely

 * the group temperature to be so low (as the warning message points out, this
   is the minimum temperature for which the XSMEKAL model is valid);

 * the galaxy emission (as represented by the `gal` component) is essentially
   0 (in fact, all the background components have changed significantly from
   the background-only fit, which should not happen since the new data included
   in the fit should not influence the background values that much since the source
   area contributes hardly any "background" signal).

If I call `plot_fit()` then the result is not a good fit to the data (since I am using the
Cash statistic I can't just use the statistic value as an indicator of the goodness of fit, unlike
the chi-square variants in Sherpa).

Darn it. I had planned to leave with a fit where the group temperature was somewhere in
the 1.5 to 2 keV range, as I had managed to get it earlier today when I was exploring
the data. So, I've done something wrong and it's not obvious what. Oh well, there's always
tomorrow. 

Happy Halloween. I guess I'm showing you the gruesome side of Science, when things don't
go as planned and you run out of time (which, thinking about it, happens most days).
