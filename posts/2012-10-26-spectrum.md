title: A spectrum?

So far I've spent too long trying to get previous/next links to appear in this
blog, so let's try and improve things and do some science.

First: where is the center of the group in chip coordinates again? I use the
[`dmcoords`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmcoords.html) tool to convert
from the celestial coordinates of the source to SKY and CHIP coordinates (I
use the non-interactive version just to be fancy). Now, because of the
[dither pattern](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/dither.html) made by
Chandra during the observation there is no one position on the detector that
matches the sky coordinate, but the values below are a good indicator.

~~~
% punlearn dmcoords
% dmcoords qimg/broad_thresh.img 1655/repro/pcadf097142619N003_asol1.fits \
           ra='7 16 44.3' dec='37 39 56' option=cel
% pget dmcoords x
4962.518225022578
% pget dmcoords y
3700.074715299584
% pget dmcoords chip_id
0
% pget dmcoords chipx
994.0953131998009
% pget dmcoords chipy
220.554982740513
~~~

Looking at the chip coordinates for ACIS-I0, we get

~~~
% ds9 ccd02.fits -bin filter 'ccd_id=0' -bin cols chipx chipy \
      -bin about 512 512 -zoom 0.5 -smooth -smooth radius 4 \
      -cmap b -saveimage png chip0.png
~~~

![The 0.5 to 7.0 keV data for ACIS-I0 displayed in chip coordinates; the group
is at `(994,221)`, with `(1,1)` being the bottom-left pixel and 
`(1024,1024)` the top-right pixel, which makes it the
emission in the bottom-right of the image.](/images/chip0.png)

## Spectral extraction

I created source and background regions by eye, to give:

~~~
% cat qspec/src.reg
circle(4962.7,3700.8,20)
% cat qspec/bg.reg 
circle(5146.5,4166.5,280)-ellipse(5142.9,4005.8,50,30,175)-ellipse(5025.3,4346.8,40,17,5)
~~~

These regions are based on the 
[source detection results from Wednesday](/posts/2012-10-24-checks.html#source-detection),
where I have changed the source shape (from elliptical to circular and reduced the
aperture size slightly) and the background region is a reasonable fraction of the
ACIS-I0 chip without having to exclude too many sources.
I took care to make sure that all the regions are on the same chip, but
I did not bother to ensure that the background region fell on the
[same node](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html)
as the source region (which I could have done, I just forgot,
because I wanted to make sure I picked a large region for estimating the background).

~~~
% ds9 ccd02.fits -log -cmap b -region qimg/src.reg \
      -bin about 5060 4080 -bin factor 4 -zoom 2
... then qspec/src.reg and qspec/bg.reg are loaded from within ds9 and
... set to being drawn in white
~~~

![The green regions show the output from `wavdetect`, the solid white is the region
I have selected for the initial source extraction (`qspec/src.reg`) and the
dotted white is the background region (`qspec/bg.reg`), which excludes two
sources using regions slightly-larger than the `wavdetect` output.](/images/source-regions.png)

A quick look at the source counts in these regions, using
[`dmstat`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmstat.html), gives

~~~
% dmstat qimg/broad_thresh.img"[sky=region(qspec/src.reg)]" cen-
EVENTS_IMAGE
    min:	0 	      @:	( 4957.5 3681.5 )
    max:	2 	      @:	( 4959.5 3699.5 )
   mean:	0.20125786164 
  sigma:	0.43840583441 
    sum:	64 
   good:	318 
   null:	123 
% dmstat qimg/broad_thresh.img"[sky=region(qspec/bg.reg)]" cen-
EVENTS_IMAGE
    min:	0 	      @:	( 5123.5 3887.5 )
    max:	2 	      @:	( 5049.5 3909.5 )
   mean:	0.014901436686 
  sigma:	0.1222565917 
    sum:	892 
   good:	59860 
   null:	18540 
~~~

so the background level within the source is small (this is for the 0.5 to 7.0 keV
band):

~~~
% chips -n
chips-1> 892 * 318 / 59860.0
         4.738656866020715
chips-2> quit()
~~~

So, there's about 59 source counts and 5 background counts in the source region.

Since there are a lot of parameters to the
[`specextract`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/specextract.html)
script, I am going to set the separately using 
[`pset`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/pset.html),
rather than give them all on the command line when calling
`specextract`. I chose to use the "extended source" analysis version
- that is set `weight=yes` and `correct=no` - since I am using a relatively large
aperture of `r=20` pixels (although the PSF is significantly larger
at this off-axis angle than at the aimpoint, 
[as discussed on Wednesday](/posts/2012-10-24-checks.html#source-detection),
it seems better to use the extended-source approach here):

Unfortunately this took a while since the calculation of the weighted
response for the background region is time consuming, as it is a relatively
large area.

We can now load this data up into
[Sherpa](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/) and see what it looks like:

![The first look at the source spectrum is not inspiring
as there just aren't that many counts there (which we expected anyway since
$\sim 60$ counts binned into groups of 20 is only going to produce $\sim 3$
bins).
](/images/qspec-initial.png)

Let's see what a thermal spectrum looks like. We start by calculating the
absorbing column of Hydrogen along the line of site in our Galaxy using
the
[`prop_colden`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/colden.html)
command-line tool (rather than the
[on-line version](http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/colden.jsp)):

~~~
% prop_colden
ASCDS_PROP_NHBASE is not set;
  default assignment to /export/local/ciao-4.4/config/jcm_data has been made.
ASCDS_PROP_NHBASE (for neutral hydrogen column density data) =
  /export/local/ciao-4.4/config/jcm_data
 ----------------- Colden ------------------
 You are now in setup mode.
 Type "c" to enter conversion mode,
      "?" to list setup mode commands,
 or   "q" to quit the program.
The default conversion is from J2000.
Colden[Setup]>: c
NHBASE directory = /export/local/ciao-4.4/config/jcm_data
RA  J2000.0: 7 16 44.3

RA  J2000.0: q
Colden[Setup]>: quit
~~~

So the column density is $n_H = 7 \times 10^{20} cm^{-2}$. Using this, we can 
construct a model of a thermal plasma - using the
[X-Spec APEC model](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsapec.html)
- which is absorbed by our Galaxy - using the
[X-Spec PHABS model](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xpshabs.html),
noting that this model has units of $10^{22} cm^{-2} for the $n_H$
parameter):

![The model (red line) is a good fit to the data, as it should be
when there are only 4 data points and 2 parameters to adjust!](/images/qspec-initial-fit.png)

So, this initial reduction suggests a gas temperature of $\sim 1.5$ keV,
although the errors are large and the analysis has a lot of flaws: for instance

 * there was no energy filtering applied, which means that data outside
   the *valid* detector range (of roughly 0.5 to 7 keV for the ACIS-I array)
   has been used and could skew the result;

 * the metallicity was fixed, but it is strongly coupled with the plasma
   temperature in groups (e.g. see the simulated spectra below); 

 * and the number of counts doesn't really justify Gaussian errors

but it gives us something to aim at.

### What units was that gas temperature in?

X-ray astronomers are quite hapry to talk about a plasma having a temperature of
1.5 keV, even though this is an energy and not a temperature. 
Why do we do this? Well, it's because 

 * there is an observational feature releated to this value
   e.g. see the Wikipedia article on
   [Thermodynamic temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature);

 * and - perhaps more importantly - the thermal models provided by the 
   [X-Spec library](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/Models.html)
   use an equivalent energy, rather than temperature, to describe the plasma.

It's not quite the same reason that particle physicists seem to
[measure everything as an energy](http://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/new/whatgevs.html).

Nowadays, rather than having to calculate things manually, we can 
just ask services like 
[Wolfram Alpha](http://wolframalpha.tumblr.com/tagged/Astronomy) all about
[1 keV](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+kev), and find out that
it is equivalent to a temperature of
$1.16 \times 10^7$ Kelvin. As a quick comparison,
[80 degrees Farenheit is equivalent to 26 meV](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=80+farenheit).

Below we show four simulated spectra, for a thermal plasma with
solar metallicities where the temperature ranges between 1 and 10 keV:

![At low energies (below the energy of the plasma), the emission is well approximated
by a power law, whereas above this value the emission starts to drop strongly. The
temperature of a plasma, when given in energy units, is a measure of this break position.
The narrow lines in these plasmas (and not-so-narrow bump just below 1 keV for the 1 keV system)
are due to emission from metallic ions in the plasma,
which makes temperature and metallicity somewhat hard to disentangle for temperatures
around 1 keV.
Unfortunately the intrinsic energy resolution of the
ACIS detectors is not good enough to resolve these features individually (for that you need
to use gratings or an X-ray micro-calorimeter such as flown on 
[Suzaku](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/astroe/astroe2.html)).
