title: A spectrum?

So far I've spent too long trying to get previous/next links to appear in this
blog, so let's try and improve things and do some science.

First: where is the center of the group in chip coordinates again? I use the
[`dmcoords`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmcoords.html) tool to convert
from the celestial coordinates of the source to SKY and CHIP coordinates (I
use the non-interactive version just to be fancy). Now, because of the
[dither pattern](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/dither.html) made by
Chandra during the observation there is no one position on the detector that
matches the sky coordinate, but the values below are a good indicator.

~~~
% punlearn dmcoords
% dmcoords qimg/broad_thresh.img 1655/repro/pcadf097142619N003_asol1.fits \
           ra='7 16 44.3' dec='37 39 56' option=cel
% pget dmcoords x
4962.518225022578
% pget dmcoords y
3700.074715299584
% pget dmcoords chip_id
0
% pget dmcoords chipx
994.0953131998009
% pget dmcoords chipy
220.554982740513
~~~

Looking at the chip coordinates for ACIS-I0, we get

~~~
% ds9 ccd02.fits -bin filter 'ccd_id=0' -bin cols chipx chipy \
      -bin about 512 512 -zoom 0.5 -smooth -smooth radius 4 \
      -cmap b -saveimage png chip0.png
~~~

![The 0.5 to 7.0 keV data for ACIS-I0 displayed in chip coordinates; the group
is at `(994,221)`, with `(1,1)` being the bottom-left pixel and 
`(1024,1024)` the top-right pixel, which makes it the
emission in the bottom-right of the image.](/images/chip0.png)

## Spectral extraction

I created source and background regions by eye, to give:

~~~
% cat qspec/src.reg
circle(4962.7,3700.8,20)
% cat qspec/bg.reg 
circle(5146.5,4166.5,280)-ellipse(5142.9,4005.8,50,30,175)-ellipse(5025.3,4346.8,40,17,5)
~~~

These regions are based on the 
[source detection results from Wednesday](/posts/2012-10-24-checks.html#source-detection),
where I have changed the source shape (from elliptical to circular and reduced the
aperture size slightly) and the background region is a reasonable fraction of the
ACIS-I0 chip without having to exclude too many sources.
I took care to make sure that all the regions are on the same chip, but
I did not bother to ensure that the background region fell on the
[same node](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html)
as the source region (which I could have done, I just forgot,
because I wanted to make sure I picked a large region for estimating the background).

~~~
% ds9 ccd02.fits -log -cmap b -region qimg/src.reg \
      -bin about 5060 4080 -bin factor 4 -zoom 2
... then qspec/src.reg and qspec/bg.reg are loaded from within ds9 and
... set to being drawn in white
~~~

![The green regions show the output from `wavdetect`, the solid white is the region
I have selected for the initial source extraction (`qspec/src.reg`) and the
dotted white is the background region (`qspec/bg.reg`), which excludes two
sources using regions slightly-larger than the `wavdetect` output.](/images/source-regions.png)

A quick look at the source counts in these regions, using
[`dmstat`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/dmstat.html), gives

~~~
% dmstat qimg/broad_thresh.img"[sky=region(qspec/src.reg)]" cen-
EVENTS_IMAGE
    min:	0 	      @:	( 4957.5 3681.5 )
    max:	2 	      @:	( 4959.5 3699.5 )
   mean:	0.20125786164 
  sigma:	0.43840583441 
    sum:	64 
   good:	318 
   null:	123 
% dmstat qimg/broad_thresh.img"[sky=region(qspec/bg.reg)]" cen-
EVENTS_IMAGE
    min:	0 	      @:	( 5123.5 3887.5 )
    max:	2 	      @:	( 5049.5 3909.5 )
   mean:	0.014901436686 
  sigma:	0.1222565917 
    sum:	892 
   good:	59860 
   null:	18540 
~~~

so the background level within the source is small (this is for the 0.5 to 7.0 keV
band):

~~~
% chips -n
chips-1> 892 * 318 / 59860.0
         4.738656866020715
chips-2> quit()
~~~

So, there's about 59 source counts and 5 background counts in the source region.

Since there are a lot of parameters to the
[`specextract`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/specextract.html)
script, I am going to set the separately using 
[`pset`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/pset.html),
rather than give them all on the command line when calling
`specextract`. I chose to use the "extended source" analysis version
- that is set `weight=yes` and `correct=no` - since I am using a relatively large
aperture of `r=20` pixels (although the PSF is significantly larger
at this off-axis angle than at the aimpoint, 
[as discussed on Wednesday](/posts/2012-10-24-checks.html#source-detection),
it seems better to use the extended-source approach here):

Unfortunately this took a while since the calculation of the weighted
response for the background region is time consuming, as it is a relatively
large area.

We can now load this data up into
[Sherpa](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/) and see what it looks like:

![The first look at the source spectrum is not inspiring
as there just aren't that many counts there (which we expected anyway since
$\sim 60$ counts binned into groups of 20 is only going to produce $\sim 3$
bins).
