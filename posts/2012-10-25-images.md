Today I don't have a lot of time, so let's check the X-ray emission
against existing observations.

## 2MASS

Using the 
[Interactive 2MASS Image Service](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/IM/interactive.html),
I have downloaded a 600 arcsec cutout in the $K_s$ band from the All-Sky Release Survey for the position
$7^h$ $16^m$ $44.3^s$ $+37^o$ 39' 56", which is shown below.
The 
[Data Tag](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DataTag/docs/instructions.html) for this data set is
`ADS/IRSA.2mass_im#2012/1025/065751_17093`.

Here we display the 2MASS $K_s$ band image with ChIPS and then overlay the
contours showing the Chandra emission. The contours were created by ds9,

~~~
% ds9 qimg/broad_flux.img -log -smooth -pan to 4960 3700 -zoom 2
~~~

using the following levels, and a smoothing scale of 3. The output
was saved to [qimg/group.con](/data/group.con) and then used in 
ChIPS below. I had aimed to use the
[`add_ds9_contours`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/add_ds9_contours.html)
routine but this didn't work, so I ended up using
[`read_ds9_contours`](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/read_ds9_contours.html)
to read in the data, then a quick spatial filter to find those contours near
the group, and then display each of these as a curve (I should really have also
added in a check on the Declination, not just the Right Ascension to save a little
work by the computer):

showing that the source we are interested in is spatially associated with the
galaxy `2MASX J07164427+3739556`. Note that many of the small blobs of emission
just to the East of this source look to be noise, due to the ACIS chip edge.](/images/2mass-overlay.png)

## Radio

The 
[NED search](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/objsearch?search_type=Near+Position+Search&in_csys=Equatorial&in_equinox=J2000.0&lon=7+16+44.3&lat=%2B37+39+55&radius=0.5&hconst=73&omegam=0.27&omegav=0.73&corr_z=1&z_constraint=Unconstrained&z_value1=&z_value2=&z_unit=z&ot_include=ANY&nmp_op=ANY&out_csys=Equatorial&out_equinox=J2000.0&obj_sort=Distance+to+search+center&of=pre_text&zv_breaker=30000.0&list_limit=5&img_stamp=YES) shows that there is also radio emission
associated with this source, `NVSS J071643+373957`. Using the 'Retrieve NVSS Image' from
this page returns a 15 arcminute FITS image:

there is also VLA FIRST data for this field, as shown below.](/images/nvss-overlay.png)

If you go to the 
[VLA FIRST archive page](http://sundog.stsci.edu/)
you can use the
[image cut-out service](http://first.astro.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/firstcutout)
to find the FIRST data for this area (the advantage over the NVSS data shown
above is the significantly better spatial resolution). I retrieved a 10 arcminute
image centered on the group, which was called `J071644+373956.fits` but I have
renamed `first.fits`:

![The image is the 2MASS $K_s$ band data with three contours:
X-ray (green); Radio, NVSS (black); and Radio, FIRST (cyan). 
The light-green shaded region shows the coverage of the ACIS-I0 chip,
showing that the second radio source, to the East of the group,
is right on the edge of the chip, and so may well not be detected.
There is a fainter $K_s$ band source (than the group galaxy) at this
location; it just may be somewhat obscured by the contours for the radio data.
](/images/radio-comparison.png)

The second radio source has a position - estimated by eye using the FIRST data -
of $7^h$ $16^m$ $32.3^s$ $+37^o$ 29' 13" - which 
[NED identifies as `NVSS J071632+373912`](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/objsearch?objname=NVSS+J071632%2B373912+&extend=no&hconst=73&omegam=0.27&omegav=0.73&corr_z=1&out_csys=Equatorial&out_equinox=J2000.0&obj_sort=RA+or+Longitude&of=pre_text&zv_breaker=30000.0&list_limit=5&img_stamp=YES),
a source provisionally associated with the 
[2MASS galaxy `2MASX J07163136+3739113`](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/objsearch?objname=2MASX%20J07163136%2B3739113&extend=no).
Perhaps this galaxy has a similar redshift to 
[`2MASX J07164427+3739556`](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/objsearch?objname=2MASX%20J07164427%2B3739556&extend=no) ($z = 0.069$),
and so is associated with it?

## What does this tell us?

Well, the X-ray emission is extremely likely to be associated with the
galaxy which we see in the optical and near-IR. This galaxy is
nearby - it has a redshift of `z = 0.069`, or `20708 km/s`, which
means that it is unassociated with the cluster target of the Chandra observation
(which has a redshift of `z=0.55`). The X-ray emission appears faint, but
extended, which is unlikely just to be the halo of the galaxy but instead
the hot gas surrounding a group of galaxies (or at least that's my hope).
One way to test this is to extract the X-ray spectrum of this emission and
see if it is well fit by a thermal plasma model and, if so, what is its
temperature. If the system is relaxed - i.e. it has not been perturbed recently
by a merger or some form of outflow from the galaxy,
so that the gas traces out the gravitational potential - then the gas
temperature is a good indicator of the total mass of the system.
One possible fly in the ointment is that the radio emission indicates that there
may be some non-thermal processes going on, which could contribute to the
X-ray spectrum and so make it hard to measure any galaxy or group emission
accurately.
