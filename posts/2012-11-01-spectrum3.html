<p>I am going to repeat <a href="../posts/2012-10-31-spectrum2.html">yesterday’s analysis</a>, but this time fixing the background model before fitting the source region. I have gone back to using the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsapec.html">APEC model</a> for describing a thermal plasma, but this should not make much of a difference, as I’ll hopefully show you below.</p>
<p>The data used here - that is the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/pha.html">PHA</a> files for the source and background regions together with the relevant response files (<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/arf.html">ARF</a> and <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/rmf.html">RMF</a>) - is <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/X-ray_spectra_for_galaxy_or_galaxy_group_in_a_Chandra_observation_of_MACS_J0717.5+3745/97108">available on FigShare</a>; I had hoped to stick in a fancy FigShare widget but it’s not obvious to me, after looking at the documentation for a whole 5 minutes, how to do that.</p>

</div>
<p>As can be seen from the transcript above, I had to fit the background several times, changing the starting point of the fit, to get to the minimum value. This is because when I added in the <code>gal</code> component, the fitting engine decided that it needed to increase the temperature (it started at 1 keV) rather than decrease it. At some level I do not care too much about these components and parameters, since it is intended as a phenomenological model of the background (since the background contamination is small it does not have to be a perfect model of the background, just describe it well). It is, however, nice to get something meaningful; well, for the thermal emission it is, but the power law slope isn’t physical, since the cosmic X-ray background measured by Chandra and XMM-Newton has a slope of <span class="math"><em>γ</em> ∼ 1. 4</span> at the depth of this observation - e.g. see the background modelling done for XMM-Newton data by <a href="http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/abs/2004ApJ...610.1182S">Snowden, Collier, and Kuntz, 2004, ApJ, 610, 1182</a>, although I did just note a recent pre-print by <a href="http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/abs/2012arXiv1210.6377M">Moretti et al.</a> describing a much flatter backgronud spectrum (<span class="math"><em>γ</em> ∼ 0. 1</span>) for a slightly-different energy range using Swift and Chandra data - and I have not included any component to account for the particle background.</p>
<p>I have decided to try fixing this background component before fitting the source since</p>
<ul>
<li><p>yesterday’s experiment, in allowing it to vary, did not work well;</p></li>
<li><p>and the source region is about 5 percent of the area of the background region and so will not improve on the background constraints.</p></li>

</div>
<p>The line at 6.7 keV is due to the presence of metals in the plasma - remembering that we X-ray Astronomers like to split the universe into Hydrogen, Helium, and then lump everything else as a metal - which we see here because the default abundance of 1 (i.e. “solar”) is high. As there is no detected emission at this energy then we may be able to constrain the metallicity in the fit (actually, the whole shape of the spectrum is sensitive to the metallicity at this temperature, as shown in the figure, but the 6.7 keV line is the most obvious individual feature).</p>
<p>I start by re-setting the abundance to 1 - to match the previous fit - <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/thaw.html">thaw it</a>, then fit and <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/conf.html">calculate the 1-sigma errors using the conf method</a>.</p>

<p>The result is that the constraints on the metallicity are not strong, but the fit now does prefer a lower temperature. As a check I look at the fit statistic as a function of the temperature and abundance parameters using the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/reg_proj.html">region-projection routine</a> (I over-ride the default parameters to better explore the search space for this particular fit):</p>

<h3 id="was-the-background-worth-bothering-with">Was the background worth bothering with?</h3>
<p>In the following I set the background model to 0 and then re-fitting, to see what happens to the source parameters. Given that the background spectrum is significantly “harder” than the source - that is the ratio of counts at high to low energies is larger in the background - I could see that excluding the background would lead to a hotter plasma temperature, as the fit tries to account for the extra high-energy events. Let’s see:</p>
<pre><code>sherpa-51&gt; bgnd.ampl = 0
sherpa-52&gt; gal.norm = 0
sherpa-53&gt; plot_bkg_fit()</code></pre>
<p>The above checks that the model is 0 (note that there isn’t an easy way to clear the background model in Sherpa, at least as far as I am aware, so setting the model to 0 is the easiest work around).</p>

<p>So the gas temperature has increased, but statistically speaking the change is not significant. The normalisation parameter of the model - i.e. the measure of the amount of gas in the source region - is essentially unchanged, as we would expect, since the background only accounts for <span class="math"> ∼ 10%</span> of the emission in the source region.</p>
<h3 id="why-all-the-re-fits">Why all the re-fits?</h3>
<p>In the session above, when I am only concerned about getting close to the best-fit parameters I just call <code>fit</code> or <code>fit_bkg</code> once, but when I want to make sure I am really at the best-fit solution I call the fit twice. Most times the parameter values - and hence best-fit statistic - do not change, which is what we want, but some times there can be a shift if the optimiser - i.e. the algorithm that is attempting to minimize the fit statistic (in this case the simplex, or Nelder Mead, algorithm) - has got caught in a local minimum. If I was after very precise measurements I might change optimiser, or move the parameters slightly and re-fit, just to check that I have the best fit location. I have not done that here, in part because some of the checks I have done whilst writing this page have essentially done this for me (and the page isnt’ exactly light reading as is).</p>
