title: Spectrum III - Third time's the charm
author: Douglas Burke
date: 1 November 2012
---

I am going to repeat 
[yesterday's analysis](/posts/2012-10-31-spectrum2.html), but this
time fixing the background model before fitting the source region.
I have gone back to using the 
[APEC model](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/xsapec.html)
for describing a thermal plasma, but this should not make
much of a difference, as I'll hopefully show you below.

The data used here - that is the PHA files for the source
and background regions together with the relevant response files
(ARF and RMF) - is 
[available on FigShare](http://figshare.com/articles/X-ray_spectra_for_galaxy_or_galaxy_group_in_a_Chandra_observation_of_MACS_J0717.5+3745/97108);
I had hoped to stick in a fancy FigShare widget but it's not obvious to me,
after looking at the documentation for a whole 5 minutes, how to do that.

![This is very similar to yesterday's plot, which had a power law with
$\gamma = -0.03$ and thermal plasma with
$kT = 0.195$ keV for solar abundance. Allowing the abundance to vary has
not changed the temperature significantly, even with the abundance falling by
a factor of $\sim 50$.](/images/bgnd-powerlaw-apec-abundance.png)

As can be seen from the transcript above, I had to fit the background several times, 
changing the starting point of the fit, to get to the minimum value. This is because
when I added in the `gal` component, the fitting engine decided that it needed to
increase the temperature (it started at 1 keV) rather than decrease it. At some level
I do not care too much about these components and parameters, since it is intended as
a phenomenological model of the background (since the background contamination is small
it does not have to be a perfect model of the background, just describe it well). It is,
however, nice to get something meaningful; well, for the thermal emission it is, but the
power law slope isn't physical, since the cosmic X-ray background measured by
Chandra and XMM-Newton has a slope of $\gamma \sim 1.4$ at the depth of this observation
- e.g. see the background modelling done for XMM-Newton data by
[Snowden, Collier, and Kuntz, 2004, ApJ, 610, 1182](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/abs/2004ApJ...610.1182S),
although I did just note a recent pre-print by
[Moretti et al.](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/ui/abs/2012arXiv1210.6377M)
describing a
much flatter backgronud spectrum ($\gamma \sim 0.1$) for a slightly-different energy range
using Swift and Chandra data
- and I have not included any component to account for the particle background.

I have decided to try fixing this background component before fitting the source since

 * yesterday's experiment, in allowing it to vary, did not work well;

 * and the source region is about 5 percent of the area of the background region and so
   will not improve on the background constraints.

![Here we see the source spectrum (red); this can be thought of as the signal that enters
Chandra, whereas the fit seen in the previous plot - which blurs out essentially all these
lines - is due to the sensitivity and performance of the telescope and the ACIS detector.
The black line shows the model when the abundance is set to 0, so the difference is the
emission due to the metals in the plasma.](/images/source-model-a1.png)

The line at 6.7 keV is due to the presence of metals in the plasma - remembering that
we X-ray Astronomers like to split the universe into Hydrogen, Helium, and then lump everything else as
a metal - which we see here because the default abundance of 1 (i.e. "solar") is high. As there is
no detected emission at this energy then we may be able to constrain the metallicity in the fit (actually, the
whole shape of the spectrum is sensitive to the metallicity at this temperature, 
as shown in the figure, but the 6.7 keV line is the most obvious individual feature).

I start by re-setting the abundance to 1 - to match the previous fit - 
[thaw it](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/thaw.html), then fit
and
[calculate the 1-sigma errors using the conf method](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/conf.html).

The result is that the constraints on the metallicity are not strong, but the
fit now does prefer a lower temperature. As a check I look at the fit statistic 
as a function of the temperature and abundance parameters using the
[region-projection routine](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/reg_proj.html)
(I over-ride the default parameters to better explore the search space for this
particular fit):

~~~
sherpa-46> reg_proj(grp.kt, grp.abundanc, min=[0.5,0], max=[5.5,3], nloop=[51,51])
sherpa-47> print_window('source-reg-proj.png')
~~~

![The cross shows the best-fit location and the contours show the 1, 2, and 3 $\sigma$
confidence contours. Although the parameters are reasonably constrained to
68% (ie the first contour), the constraint is significantly worse at higher confidence
levels. The emission is, however, constrained to be $> 1$ keV to more than $3\sigma$;
at least if the metallicity is above 0.3 solar.](/images/source-reg-proj.png)

Looking at the final fit we get:

sherpa-48> plot_fit()
sherpa-49> set_curve('crv1', ['line.style', 'solid', 'symbol.style', 'none'])
sherpa-50> print_window('source-xsapec.png')
~~~

![The model looks very similar to the previous fit above, when the abundance was set
to solar, except for the lack of the 6.7 keV line and the peak at 1.5 keV
is no longer so separated from the one at 1 keV.](/images/source-xsapec.png)

### Was the background worth bothering with?

In the following I set the background model to 0 and then re-fitting, to see what happens
to the source parameters. Given that the background spectrum is significantly "harder" than
the source - that is the ratio of counts at high to low energies is larger in the background - 
I could see that excluding the background would lead to a hotter plasma temperature, as the fit
tries to account for the extra high-energy events. Let's see:

~~~
sherpa-51> bgnd.ampl = 0
sherpa-52> gal.norm = 0
sherpa-53> plot_bkg_fit()
~~~

The above checks that the model is 0 (note that there isn't an easy way to clear the
background model in Sherpa, at least as far as I am aware, so setting the model to 0 is
the easiest work around).

So the gas temperature has increased, but statistically speaking the
change is not significant. The normalisation parameter of the model - i.e. the
measure of the amount of gas in the source region - is essentially unchanged,
as we would expect, since the background only accounts for $\sim 10\%$ of the
emission in the source region.

### Why all the re-fits?

In the session above, when I am only concerned about getting close to the best-fit parameters
I just call `fit` or `fit_bkg` once, but when I want to make sure I am really at the best-fit
solution I call the fit twice. Most times the parameter values - and hence best-fit statistic -
do not change, which is what we want, but some times there can be a shift if the optimiser - i.e.
the algorithm that is attempting to minimize the fit statistic (in this case the simplex,
or Nelder Mead, algorithm) - has got caught in a local minimum. If I was after very precise
measurements I might change optimiser, or move the parameters slightly and re-fit, just to check that
I have the best fit location. I have not done that here, in part because some of the checks I have
done whilst writing this page have essentially done this for me (and the page isnt' exactly light
reading as is).
