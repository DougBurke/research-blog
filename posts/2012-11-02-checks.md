title: Checking the spectral fit
author: Douglas Burke
date: 2 November 2012
---

One concern I have when doing a fit - whether to spectra, images, or other data - is
how sensitive are the results to the "initial conditions", that is often thought of
as the starting parameter values (which, as I will show below, can change things),
but can also be thought of as the energy range used for the analysis (amongst other
things).

## Scripting things

To avoid too much typing, and keep things repeatable, I have combined yesterday's
analysis steps into the script [`fit_group.py`](/data/fit_group.py)
that defines the Python function `dofit` with the following signature:

sherpa-2> help(dofit)
Help on function dofit in module __main__:

dofit(elo=0.5, ehi=7.0, fixbgnd=True)
    Fit group.pi with an absorbed APEC model over the
    energy range elo to ehi (in keV) using the Cash statistic.
    The background is modeled as a powerlaw + thermal model
    (both absorbed), fitted separately, then fixed before
    fitting the source (unless fixbgnd is False).

~~~

As a check I run it with no arguments, so that it should repeat
[yesterday's fit](/posts/2012-11-01-spectrum3.html):

[Full screen output](/data/fit-source-bgnd-0.5-7.0.txt)

So, the fit results are *slightly* different to those from yesterday,
namely

~~~

   Param            Best-Fit  Lower Bound  Upper Bound
   -----            --------  -----------  -----------

   grp.norm      5.19229e-05 -1.53405e-05  1.63004e-05
~~~

and it is actually a a *slightly-better* fit, since the fit statistic
here is `750.072` versus `750.483` from yesterday. However, note that
the fit results are actually very similar if you look at how different they are
in terms of the error (e.g. the temperature difference is $\sim 0.04$ keV,
which is a lot smaller than the $\sim 0.2$ keV error), as expected since 
the difference in the 
[Cash statistic](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/ahelp/cash.html) 
is $\sim 0.4$ (since the difference in Cash statistic can be equated to the
$\delta \chi^2$ distribution, this is less than a $1 \sigma$ change).

Why the difference? Well, yesterday I ended up with a slightly-different
set of background parameters because I did not change the gas temperature
of the `gal` component before fitting (so yesterday it started at 1 keV
but the script changes this to 0.2 keV). This results in the difference
seen above.

I have also created a command `doplot` that shows the source and background
fits (it customises the default Sherpa plot hence the need for a command):

~~~

~~~

![The top plot shows the source fit and the bottom plot the background fit
when using the 0.5 to 7.0 keV range.](/images/fit-source-bgnd-0.5-7.0.png)

### Expanding the energy range

There is valid ACIS-I data outside the energy range 0.5 to 7.0 keV but I did not use it
because

 * the sensitivity drops strongly outside this energy range so it is unlikely to
   add much to the analysis;

 * the background level increases (in particular at higher energies);

 * the calibration is not as accurate, in particular below 0.5 keV.

However, I am going to try changing the energy range to see what happens; first
by using the 0.3 to 8.0 keV range. I have not included the full screen output, as I did
above, for these
runs, but they are available for download.

First I compare the source spectrum to the sensitivity of the detector, as measured
by the [ARF](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/dictionary/arf.html):

~~~

sherpa-18> set_axis('all', ['label.size', 18])
sherpa-19> set_plot_title(r'\color{red}Source spectrum  \color{default}ARF')
sherpa-20> print_window('source-arf.png')
~~~

![The red line shows the source spectrum (before it enters the telescope) in red, and the
effective area (aka ARF) in black. Both are drawn with a logarithmic scale on the ordinate
axis. The two vertical lines show the position of the 0.5 and 7.0 keV energies; outside
these values the combination of `source * ARF` drops quickly.](/images/source-arf.png)

### 0.3 to 8.0 keV

So, now the 0.3 to 8.0 keV results (done using a new Sherpa session just to make sure that
there is no problem with some setting from the previous analysis affecting the results):

The background model has struggled to account for the new data (the background increase at higher energies
should probably be modelled by a separate power law or, in this particular case, a gaussian line,
but this extra complexity is not worth it for this analysis);
not shown in the output elided above is the fact that the temperature
of the `gal` component is stuck at it's minimum temperature ($\sim 0.1$ keV)
and abundance (0).
Overall the source parameters or their errors are not significantly different.

![The reduction in energy range means that the single power law component 
appears to be a better fit to the background](/images/fit-source-bgnd-0.6-5.0.png)

The `gal` component of the background has an unphysical abundance of $\sim 10$ times solar
in this fit, but the results overall remain the same. Note that the reduction in the
high-energy limit could correspond to the slight increase in best-fit temperature, since
there is less of a constraint, but I am probably reading too much into the small changes.

## The takeaway message?

It looks like the exact choice of energy range used in the analysis does not significantly
influence the results. Now, that's not to say that this is done and dusted, since I havent'
proved that the emission is actually from a thermal plasma, since I haven't tried fitting anything
else to it!

## A powerlaw?

So, does a power law fit as well? I use the same script as above to fit the 0.5 to 7.0
keV data, then change the source model to be an absorbed power law:

![The power-law model is shown in red and the thermal plasma model in blue. 
The peak in the emission at 1 keV looks to be better fit by the thermal model
but it really isn't clear that we can discriminate between these two models
from the spectrum alone.](/images/fit-apec-powerlaw-comparison.png)

So, the emission can be adequately explained either as from a hot plasma
or from some power-law (non thermal) process. Given that the X-ray emission 
is from an extended region, rather than a point source, the plasma model is
preferred, *but* one complication is that there could be both processes
present - an extended plasma and a power-law component in the central galaxy,
since the galaxy does show (faint) radio emission.

As is commonly seen on telescope proposals, more data is needed!
